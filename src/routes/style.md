# Makeup Style

So you want to makeup some styling?

Here's the CSS that fixes default browser CSS (no IE though), for narrow viewports first, and provides the intuitive default CSS for styling in general and typographic style.


## contain.css

```css
@import 'makeup-style/src/contain.css';
```

CSS to prevent text and content from overflowing and prevents elements from disrupting the default vertical rhythm by affecting line-height.
