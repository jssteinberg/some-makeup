# Notes

## Library guide

- File names as actions.

## Space

"space.css" as file name. `--space` as a variable name.

In the library I created before this, the variable was eventually renamed `--spacer`. Mostly to be more in style with Bootstrap naming. "Space" is shorter and I like that the file has the same name. Space. The file can't be named "spacer". An import now looks likes this: `@import 'makeup-style/src/space.css'`. It's like an action you take. Space CSS! You also "fix CSS!" "Spacer CSS" doesn't work.

Another option could be "flow". Flow CSS! `--flow` as variable name. Or `--flow-space` to give it more meaning, but I like to use shorter variable names when I can. The same with "rhythm". So I'm sticking with "space".
