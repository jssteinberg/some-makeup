# makeup-style

So you want to makeup style? These minimal CSS files corrects and improves default browser CSS---for narrow viewports first---and provides convenient and intuitive CSS-defaults for styling in general and typographic style.

```
npm install makeup-style
```

## 1. *Default CSS*

```css
@import "makeup-style/default.css";
/* Or an alternative using `:where()` for less specificity: */
@import "makeup-style/where-default.css";
```

It corrects and improves the minimal necessary default CSS for all screen sizes, narrow viewports first. That includes universally using the `border-box` for preventing overflow and making styling way more intuitive, otherwise preventing overflowing content, default corrections for typographic style, normalize default semantics, basic default usability and correct certain elementsâ€™ alignments. All rules are included with the mindset of this being a minimal default CSS, which includes embracing certain CSS defaults like heading styles and spacing.

This file is an updated alternative to
[normalize.css][nc],
[modern-normalize][mn],
[CSS Remedy][cr],
[sanitize.css][sc] and similar---updated for all major browsers and new CSS. When it comes to normalization, it does not always do a full normalization for elements that works and are consistent to style, and/or that are specifically styled when they are relevant.

<em slot="summary">Notes</em>

*All libraries should have honest notes on drawbacks and/or missing support:*

1. `code, kbd, samp, sub, sup` are inline elements Default CSS styles to not affect line-heights. If they are used as block-level elements though, they will be short in height since their `line-height` is adjusted. E.g., if their direct parent uses `grid` or `flex`. Solution is to redo your HTML structure or restyle `line-height` for these elements in this context.

2. To allow browsers to auto hyphenate words when text wraps, `hyphens: auto` is applied. *The support may still be lacking for some languages in some browsers.* `hyphens: manual` may be set (for some elements) on wider viewports and/or for advanced content creators who knows `shy`.

3. Margin for `<body>` is not removed. So you usually also want `body { margin: 0; }`.

`<hr>` 'border' uses `height` and `background` for a nicer border. This makes it easy to adjust:

```css
hr {
	/* Gradient border */
	background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, red, blue);
	/* Change size */
	background-size: 5em 2px;
	/* Change position */
	background-position: left center;
	/* Change spacing */
	height: 2em;
}
```
