# makeup-style

Minimal CSS files for correcting and improving default browser CSS, for narrow viewports first, and provides convenient and intuitive CSS-defaults for styling in general and typographic style.

```
./src/default.css";
./src/develop.css";
./src/where-default.css";
./src/where-develop.css";
```

[Installation and documentation](https://some.makeup/style)

*Inspired by The Elements of Typographic Style, [normalize.css][nc], [modern-normalize][mn], [CSS Remedy][cr], [sanitize.css][sc], [Open Props][op], [A modern CSS reset][amcr] (there's also [this custom CSS reset][mccr]).*

## Plans

*This repo is a mess. A fix-up is slowly in the works. If you somehow stumbled over this library and would like it sped up, e.g., for contributions, please create an issue/request.*

Plan v2:

- Support variable font, e.g., for `b, strong`.
- [-] Wrap stuff in `:where()` or use `@layer`. *`:where()` is available in alt. files.*

Nope:

- Remove `[hidden]` ... `display: none`? Should be implemented in all used browsers now. *No! It's for maintaining behaviour.*

default.css maybes:

- Let SVG scale without boundaries:

	```css
	img[src$=".svg"] {
		width: 100%;
		height: auto;
		max-width: none;
	}
	```

<details>

<summary>Naming process</summary>

- ( ) default.css, developer.css, space.css, typography.css (for potential style-some)
- (-) default.css, develop.css, (space.css, typography.css)

## History

*makeup-style is the updated, slightly more opinionated remake of my own [Floor Typography CSS](https://floortypography.vercel.app).*

*Changes from Floor Typography CSS v22:*

- Updated default CSS revising and normalizing, more tested.
- Less files and features, more quality.
- `--line-span` var for headings (not `--hâ€¦-min-font-size`).
- `--space` var for controlling spacing (not `--spacer`).
	- Space is not removed for sub-lists (would cause unexpected list styles if parent list was styled unconventional. Rather remove margin for sub-lists in containers of choice).
